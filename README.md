Creating and manipulating Pandas Data Frames 
I was given two datasets for "student data", and "school data" to analyze along with the subsequent test results.
I will use the schools standardized test data to help the school board and local officials to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets distrubution and priorities.

As a first task, I was provideded the district-wide standardized test results. This included every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I aggregated data to showcase obvious trends in school performance via the necesarry calculations using panadas and Jupyter Notebook to create this report.

Note: This assignment was challenge as it ought to be. I sought hel for clarity from my peers and sourced codes syntax I did not author or create from online forums such as Stack Overflow, and Google.
